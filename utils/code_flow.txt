1. Data Loading (Currently Working on) - 1. Creating df with image path (this will be done directly with the augmented image)
                                         2. Cropping image using cv2 method 
                                         3. Creating a df for the cropped image. 
Step 1 is done               

2. Data Preprocessing - 1. Split the data into training and val set (approx 80 - 20 split) Done
                        2. Create the dataset class which will perform transform (Resizing and converting to tensor). Done
                        3. Create train and val loader  
Step 2 is done 
3. Training - Write the model class
         - Write the traning func 
            - Capture traning loss after evey epoch 
            - Capture val loss after every epoch

Step 3 is Done 

Inference and validation report- Function for inference on a test image using store model
Done
